Introduction
------------
These applications are used to demonstrate texture streaming with the SGX
GPU on the OMAP4 SoC utilizing the the V4L2-GFX driver built again a Linux
kernel.

These apps are developed on both Linux & Android.

Dependencies
------------
All the applications need the V4L2-GFX driver installed.

The applications need the header file for private ioctls to the V4L2-GFX driver
see:

https://github.com/tonylo/v4l2-gfx/tree/master/include/linux/omap_v4l2_gfx.h

v4l2_gfx_client
---------------

    Unit tests for the V4L2-GFX driver. It can also memcpy frames from a raw
NV12 file to the V4L2-GFX device.

gles1_texture_player
--------------------

    GLES1 application demonstrating texture streaming. This will just stream
a flat video image, so is useful to see the basic throughput of a video stream
without the overhead of 3D effects.

Sub-directories:
    src          Common native C source code
    android      Build an Android APK and a C shared library used with JNI
    linux        Null window build

Running gles1_texture_player (Linux)
------------------------------------

    Start the gles1_texture_player application from the command line. You
should see a message "Waiting for MM device". At this point you need to start
a V4L2 client application decoding to the V4L2-GFX device.

    If the V4L2-GFX device node is /dev/video100 (usually it is), ensure that
the decoding application has permission to write to the device.

    Here is an example using GStreamer (From a Ubuntu-Maverick OMAP image with
a working GStreamer setup):

    gst-launch playbin2 uri=file:///home/ubuntu/batman_begins_1080p.mov video-sink="fpsdisplaysink text-overlay=false video-sink=v4l2sink\ device=/dev/video100\ min-queued-bufs=3"

    You can also use the v4l2_gfx_client as mentioned above, although consider
that the system performance will be severely effected by the app having to 
copy frames to V4L2 memory mapped buffers. For example:

    v4l2_gfx_client -f 320x240.nv12 -w 320 -h 240

gles2_texture_player
--------------------

    GLES2 texture streaming application, similar to GLES1 except a simple
3D effect is applied.

Sub-directories:
    src          Common native C source code
    android      Build an Android APK and a C shared library used with JNI
    linux        Null window build
